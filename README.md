# Cloud Computing Basics

## Introduction to Cloud Computing

This repository documents my journey through the Introduction to Cloud Computing course, focusing on understanding cloud concepts, exploring major cloud providers, and conducting a comparative analysis of their services across different regions.

## Course Overview

- **What is Cloud Computing?**: Explores the basics of cloud services delivered over the Internet, offering scalable resources and flexible pricing.
- **Cloud Service Models**: Detailed look into IaaS, PaaS, and SaaS, outlining their specific uses and industry applications.
- **Cloud Deployment Models**: Examination of public, private, and hybrid clouds, each serving different organizational needs based on security, scalability, and resource requirements.
- **Cloud Computing Providers**: Overview of major providers such as AWS, Azure, and Google Cloud, focusing on their unique features and market offerings.
- **Review and Pricing Comparison**: A hands-on comparison of pricing for standard services across different geographical regions using each provider's pricing calculator.

## Steps Taken

1. **Account Setup**: Created free-tier accounts on AWS, Azure, and Google Cloud.
2. **Learning Modules**: Completed course modules on cloud fundamentals, service models, and deployment strategies.
3. **Pricing Comparison**:
   - Utilized the pricing calculators of AWS, Azure, and Google Cloud.
   - Compared the costs of a basic virtual machine instance across various regions such as US East, US West, Europe, and Asia.
   - I also compared the storage service prices for each platforms

## Lessons Learned

- **Global Reach vs. Local Pricing**: Discovered that cloud providers adjust their pricing based on the region, reflecting the operational costs and data sovereignty laws of each locale. This impacts the decision-making process for selecting data centers closer to the user base or in regions offering economic benefits.
- **Scalability and Elasticity**: Cloud services provide the flexibility to scale resources up or down based on demand, which is crucial for handling varying loads without over-investing in hardware.
- **Cost Management and Optimization**: Learned the importance of choosing the right service type and configuration to optimize costs. Providers offer various tools and pricing models (such as pay-as-you-go, reserved instances) to help manage expenses more effectively.
- **Service Models Fit Different Needs**: Each service model (IaaS, PaaS, SaaS) caters to different organizational needs. For example, IaaS offers extensive control over operating systems and hardware, PaaS simplifies application deployment without managing underlying infrastructure, and SaaS provides ready-to-use applications.
- **Security and Compliance**: Gained insights into the shared responsibility model where the security of cloud services is divided between the provider and the client. Also, learned about the importance of compliance with regulations, which can dictate the choice of provider and service.
